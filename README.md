The bot is initiate with the command "/start".

The users can create a poll with the command "/create pollName publicOrPrivate"

At the creation of a poll, the creator decide weather it is public or private. Only him can share it if the private option is chosen, in a group or a private message. If the public option is chosen, anyone already participating to the poll can share it.

The creator have to decide also if the votes are anonymous (in this case, numbers will be displayed) or not (username will be used). By default, the votes are anonymous but the command "/changePrivacy privacy" can be used to enable the username mode.

If wanted, the creator can also set the different answers that the users can vote with the command "/edit". Each line will be interpreted as a new option until the command "/stopEdit". If not, preset choices are taken (very bad, bad, acceptable, good, very good, neutral).

After this, the process of creation of a pole is finished. Users can now vote and change it if needed with the command "/vote option"

Publics polls are searchable by keywords, publics polls could also be retrieved by last posted or most / less answers (opt.)

The users can access their different polls and their results by typing the command "/myPolls".
